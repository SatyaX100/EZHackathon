AI Blog Generator
Description:
This project is a web application that leverages the power of AI to generate blog posts. The frontend, built with React, provides a user-friendly interface for inputting prompts and viewing the generated content. The backend, developed in Python, utilizes AI models to process the prompts and produce high-quality blog posts. The generated content is then uploaded to a GitHub repository.
